        <h2>Hello & Welcome!</h2>
      </div>
      <p>My name is James Diefenderfer and this site serves as a gallery of the programming projects that I've completed in the past few years. In the future, I plan to use it more for sharing details of my life and travels.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in summer internship opportunities in software engineering, preferably in the Bay Area. Most of my experience outside of school has been in web development, beginning with a school project where I created a precursor to this very site in 2nd grade. My personal curiosity, education at Berkeley, and past summer internships have all greatly helped in furthering my skills. I enjoy working on all aspects of my projects from user experience to the underlying data modeling and technologies used.</p>

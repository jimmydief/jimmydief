        <h2>Hello & Welcome!</h2>
      </div>
      <p>My name is James Diefenderfer and this site serves as a gallery of the programming projects that I've completed in the past few years. In the future, I plan to also use it for sharing details of my life and travels.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in fulltime software engineering opportunities in the Bay Area. My experience with computer science began with a school project where I created a precursor to this very site in 2nd grade. My personal curiosity, education at Berkeley, and past summer internships have all greatly helped in furthering my skills. I enjoy working on all aspects of my projects from user experience to low-level implementation.</p>
